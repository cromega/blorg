## My god, it's full of letters.

And with this important statement I would like to take the opportunity to grab the figurative bottle of champagne and toss it at this blog.

It's been brewing for a long time. The blog, not the champagne.

After years of working with ~~horrible~~ cutting edge cloud technologies that solve all the problems of every possible client, the need to vent finally became stronger than the general unwillingness to set up and run a blog.

There have been earlier attempts but they all failed mostly because I didn't really want to work on a blog hard enough to care.

Now, creating a blog these days is a pretty mundane task, I had to think hard to come up with ideas that were "unique" enough that implementing them would keep me entertained for a longer period.

Right now it is still a very young specimen, not much more than a markdown document and a few templates. This is probably the high-point of it all. It will go downhill very rapidly from here on in terms of how I want to implement the functionality I would like to see. But hey, that's the point of the whole exercise.

Long story short, I will share articles about tech, games, books, food & drinks and other garbage here. The articles are guaranteed to be politically correct to a certain degree.

Without further ado,

5, 4, 3, 1, OFFBLAST!
