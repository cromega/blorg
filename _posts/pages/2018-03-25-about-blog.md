This blog is based on a horrible idea. Multiple horrible ideas, to be precise.

It's a static blog generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It would be nice if it was all there is to it but alas, it's not.

The UI is some home-baked Javascript garbage that fetches the articles that are just JSON files served by the backend. It's practically a single-page application with a statically generated backend.

Why?

I have no idea so here's a bunny with a pancake on its head.

The blog is running on my little personal PaaS, which is a tiny Docker Swarm cluster with some extra plumbing to allow hostname based routing to containers (using [Traefik](https://traefik.io)) and other things. More info on it in an article a bit later
