This blog is based on a horrible idea. Multiple horrible ideas, to be precise.

It's a static blog generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It would be nice if it was all there is to it but alas, it's not.

The UI is some home-baked Javascript garbage that fetches the articles that are just JSON files served by the backend. It's practically a single-page application with a statically generated backend.

Why?

I have no idea so here's a bunny with a pancake on its head.
