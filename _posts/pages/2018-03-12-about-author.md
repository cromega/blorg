I'm Bence Monus. I solve problems.

According to my work email signature I'm a senior software engineer but it's actually a blatant lie. While I have loads of experience writing backend services in Ruby and Go, it's not how I would describe what I do. What I really do is duct taping the internets together.

It's all a mix of coding, devops, un-screwing projects and being very opinionated about certain things, such as the meaning of the term "devops". I specialise in adopting 4 letter acronyms like IaaS and PaaS. I'm a big fan of Continuous Deployment using the aforementioned acronyms and I like helping companies to get there.

In my free time I like playing video games, coding stuff, duct taping even more things, cooking and brooding over when I get back to practicing martial arts again.
